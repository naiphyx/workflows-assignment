# Third assignment

> This is the third assignment for Web Production Workflows

This assignment is all about project setups. At the end we want to have a nice
skeleton for all our new projects. We can even use [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
to automize this step in the future.

# Setup

```js
npm install
```

# Test

```
npm test
```
